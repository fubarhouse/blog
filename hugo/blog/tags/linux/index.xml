      <description>I won&amp;rsquo;t lie, when I started my current career I was a Windows guy, which now seems blasphemous to me. I was introduced to MacOS when my career shifted into the development space. I wanted to be in the development space so the shift was very intentional, but I started out publishing content &amp;amp; administering websites. Little did I know at the time how much more I hungered for.
I was very uncomfortable with MacOS at first, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t strictly opposed, and I eventually learnt to love MacOS.</description>

      <description>About five years ago my life was transformed when a certain video game was released. It was around this time I was exploring the idea of how I could move away from using Microsoft products. However the two options I had weren&amp;rsquo;t appropriate enough. Mac simply was hopeless when it came to gaming and Linux wasn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; mature enough, in that space. It was however on a trajectory so timing wasn&amp;rsquo;t favourable.</description>
