      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Karl and I&amp;rsquo;m a technologist who primarily works with PHP and Go, however I&amp;rsquo;m quite familiar with Java, Ruby, JavaScript/Nodejs, Bash and various other languages, and I&amp;rsquo;m in the process of learning Crystal and Rust.
I&amp;rsquo;m employed to work with Drupal as a specialist, and I&amp;rsquo;m an advocate of the proverbs and values supported by the Go programming language.
In the Drupal space, I have extensive experience with administration, site building, themes, modules (custom and contributed), back-end, release management etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Karl, and I&amp;rsquo;m a passionate technologist who loves programming languages and tooling.
I primarily work with automation, Drupal and of course the Go programming language.
I love to learn new technologies and challenge myself with operational work.
Challenges are of great interest to me, I love to understand the root cause of problems.
Challenges with my expertise are also hard to come by in my industry.
values A lot of my professional values are encompassed by the principals presented by the Go programming language.</description>
