I'm Karl, and I'm a passionate technologist who loves programming languages and tooling.

I primarily work with automation, Drupal and of course the Go programming language.

I love to learn new technologies and challenge myself with operational work.

Challenges are of great interest to me, I love to understand the root cause of problems.

Challenges with my expertise are also hard to come by in my industry.

### values

A lot of my professional values are encompassed by the principals presented by the Go programming language. These values stem from simplicity, readability, community, ability to embrace and be approachable.

Go proverbs support these values, and I try to bring the value I see in them to all my work.

Go has helped me identify my values as a developer in the wider community, and I encourage everybody to be somewhat familiar with the community.

I can recommend some excellent resources if you are interested.

### history

I was born to work in this space, and I still remember the amazement as a small child witnessing a loop in a console.

I started working with web in roughly 2002, but I have far more interest in back-end web development, and operational workflow.

Over the years, I've learned web (general), Pascal, JavaScript, Java, PHP, Ruby, Node.js and Go. Even though I do know more languages than many of my peers, I really shine when I work with PHP or Go, as they're the languages I use almost every day.

Having said that, I am slowly getting some ropes in Rust and Crystal, but I'm in no rush to learn either.

### goals

I don't really enjoy working on specific problems anymore, simply because I don't feel challenged. I want to be giving back to the community with tools and expertise.

One way I do this is through my work in Ansible, however what I really want is to become a technology leader for a team of diverse open source technologies.

I must admit the road getting there isn't well lit, but I'm passionate enough to believe that I'll get there eventually.
