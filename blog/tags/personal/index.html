It used to be about the gaming experience. It used to be about the platform and the investment of story-telling.
Some of the values still exist if you look hard enough. But, if you look at Reddit and any other online community, all you can see is RGB lighting, bloating, egotistical behavior, repeatable arena-based multi-player games with micro-transactions, insulting your mate&rsquo;s mother and nothing really of interest other than the granular passion for components and well&hellip; Windows.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/personal/">personal</a><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/pcmr/">pcmr</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2020-03-26/">

 Nobody in Australia was ready for Summer of 2019/2020.
The Planeteers comprised of Earth, Fire, Wind, Water and Heart. This can all be correlated to the season we&rsquo;ve had here and of course more broadly is the organic and natural evolution to the seemingly biological Coronavirus identified as COVID-19.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/personal/">personal</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2020-03-03/">
            <p class="note title">Year of the Linux desktop</p><p class="note date">March 3, 2020</p><p class="note content">About five years ago my life was transformed when a certain video game was released. It was around this time I was exploring the idea of how I could move away from using Microsoft products. However the two options I had weren&rsquo;t appropriate enough. Mac simply was hopeless when it came to gaming and Linux wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; mature enough, in that space. It was however on a trajectory so timing wasn&rsquo;t favourable.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/personal/">personal</a><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/linux/">linux</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2020-01-01/">

The very big year that so many goals were created when I entered the APS in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency as a mere web administrator working primarily with SharePoint and publishing content.
I want to open with a note about the Australian bushfires - so much damage. We must recognize that we are lucky to have the circumstances we did.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/personal/">personal</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2019-05-28/">
            <p class="note title">A delicious apple salad.</p><p class="note date">May 27, 2019</p><p class="note content">There are a few things in life which I really love. Consistency, simplicity, reliability and maintainability. Note that configurability and controllability are not in that list. There are not many mass-consumable things which marry these principles, which is unfortunate.
