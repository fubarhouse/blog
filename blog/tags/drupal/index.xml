      <description>In November this year I was lucky enough to be flown to Hobart for DrupalSouth - one of the biggest Drupal conventions of the year in Australia. It&#39;s a couple of days where an enormous portion of Drupal skill in Australia is in a single spot - it&#39;s not a time where you&#39;d want a security release or vulnerability to become public.
Let me be clear here, it&#39;s incredibly rare I go anywhere let alone on a plane for work.</description>

      <description>Not too long ago, one of DrupalACT&amp;lsquo;s developers made a blog post suggesting a developer is not just a developer anymore.
The author maintains the fact proudly that they&#39;re probably being a bit grumpy, however there&#39;s a lot of merit in this line of thought.
When starting out, it was all about the full-stack developer - the LAMP developer. The fact is, a full stack developer simply has a well-rounded set of skills for a particular type of technology which is usually centric to a given language or technology.</description>
