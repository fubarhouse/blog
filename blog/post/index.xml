      <description>I started 2018 believing I could achieve reinventing myself, like so many did. Foolish, I know. But no matter the circumstance, a holiday is a great catalyst for this.
Reinventing myself included short-term goals and contributing progress to long-term goals.
Last year my milestones were impeded by my employer for a variety of reasons outside of my control. Early in the year I needed a move out of my very comfortable situation, so my first successful application was submitted in April, and the application which landed my new job was submitted in August.</description>

      <description>Not too long ago, one of DrupalACT&amp;rsquo;s developers made a blog post suggesting a developer is not just a developer anymore.
The author maintains the fact proudly that they&amp;rsquo;re probably being a bit grumpy, however there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of merit in this line of thought.
When starting out, it was all about the full-stack developer - the LAMP developer. The fact is, a full stack developer simply has a well-rounded set of skills for a particular type of technology which is usually centric to a given language or technology.</description>
