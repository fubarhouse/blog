Foolish, I know. But no matter the circumstance, a holiday is a great catalyst for this.</p>
<p>Reinventing myself included short-term goals and contributing progress to long-term goals.</p>
<p>Last year my milestones were impeded by my employer for a variety of reasons outside of my control. Early in the year I needed a move out of my very comfortable situation, so my first successful application was submitted in April, and the application which landed my new job was submitted in August.</p>
<p>Now this issue is no longer a barrier to reinventing myself, I wish to approach 2019 with the original intentions, plus some.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take better care of myself, physically and medically.</li>
<li>Drink less coffee - because I have a very unhealthy amount almost daily.</li>
<li>Spend more time at home and with family.</li>
<li>Learn at least one new language - I&rsquo;ve marked Rust and C# for this year.</li>
<li>Work towards long-term career goals in a meaningful way.</li>
</ol>
