It used to be about the gaming experience. It used to be about the platform and the investment of story-telling.
Some of the values still exist if you look hard enough. But, if you look at Reddit and any other online community, all you can see is RGB lighting, bloating, egotistical behavior, repeatable arena-based multi-player games with micro-transactions, insulting your mate&rsquo;s mother and nothing really of interest other than the granular passion for components and well&hellip; Windows.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/personal/">personal</a><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/pcmr/">pcmr</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2020-03-26/">

 Nobody in Australia was ready for Summer of 2019/2020.
The Planeteers comprised of Earth, Fire, Wind, Water and Heart. This can all be correlated to the season we&rsquo;ve had here and of course more broadly is the organic and natural evolution to the seemingly biological Coronavirus identified as COVID-19.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/personal/">personal</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2020-03-03/">

It was around this time I was exploring the idea of how I could move away from using Microsoft products. However the two options I had weren&rsquo;t appropriate enough. Mac simply was hopeless when it came to gaming and Linux wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; mature enough, in that space. It was however on a trajectory so timing wasn&rsquo;t favourable.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/personal/">personal</a><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/linux/">linux</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2020-01-01/">

The very big year that so many goals were created when I entered the APS in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency as a mere web administrator working primarily with SharePoint and publishing content.

Consistency, simplicity, reliability and maintainability. Note that configurability and controllability are not in that list. There are not many mass-consumable things which marry these principles, which is unfortunate.
I admit before my current career in development began in 2012 I used Windows every day for everything.

This year should be rather exciting for me, but I&rsquo;ve stretched the expected goals with some desirable and not-so-desirable goals.
I started with a new employer late last year and I believe I&rsquo;ve been there long enough to allow the dust to settle. The workloads there are expected to double in the coming 12 months on one project alone and there are multiple projects existing and forthcoming.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2018-12-25/">

Reinventing myself included short-term goals and contributing progress to long-term goals.
Last year my milestones were impeded by my employer for a variety of reasons outside of my control. Early in the year I needed a move out of my very comfortable situation, so my first successful application was submitted in April, and the application which landed my new job was submitted in August.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2018-11-14/">
            <p class="note title">The barrier of entry</p><p class="note date">November 14, 2018</p><p class="note content">Not too long ago, one of DrupalACT&lsquo;s developers made a blog post suggesting a developer is not just a developer anymore.
The author maintains the fact proudly that they&rsquo;re probably being a bit grumpy, however there&rsquo;s a lot of merit in this line of thought.
When starting out, it was all about the full-stack developer - the LAMP developer. The fact is, a full stack developer simply has a well-rounded set of skills for a particular type of technology which is usually centric to a given language or technology.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/career/">career</a><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/drupal/">drupal</a><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/government/">government</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/blog/post/2018-11-01/">

 My previous position gave me a very broad introduction and in some cases mastery of particular skills, and this was lead by a friend and mentor which I moved into his team four years ago.
I am continuing to explore multiple streams of skills, but I have a focus on Go/Rust, DevOps and CI/CD - which aren&rsquo;t even part of my professional skill-set yet.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/blog/tags/career/">career</a></p></li></ul></div><section id="footer" class="footer"><div class="footer-wrap">
