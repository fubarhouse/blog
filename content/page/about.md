My name is Karl Hepworth, and I'm a bit of an enthusiast of software, software tooling and generally fun stuff in the digital age. I love working on tooling, automation and things which support people to do fun work. I also love back-end development, but I don't get many chances.

I do work for a government in a technical position, and I hope that continues. I generally do struggle for challenge so I'm open to where my career will take me.
