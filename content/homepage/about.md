My name is Karl. I'm a self-taught open source developer with an interest in Drupal, Go, tooling and automation. I also love back-end development of almost any kind.

I'm the luckiest father and husband in the world, for we have one daughter who my life would be incomplete without. We live in a rather under-rated city of Canberra, Australia. I say under-rated because only those that live here really "get" it.

I do work for a government in a technical position. I'm always looking for the next challenge in the DevOps and System Engineering space as I'm transitioning from an application developer to a platform developer working with DevOps - as I have been doing vocationally for some years.

My work does not allow me to share certain details, though I will try to remain as open as possible. You can find me all over the internet so please ping me if you have any questions.
