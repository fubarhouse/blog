Here are the reasons I've apprehensive to the language:

* Package management is reasonably messy (Though, where isn't it?)
* Millions of different variants of the python language, which breeds trouble.
* Tension between Python2 and Python3 impedes the evolution of the language.
* One of the few Python applications I use doesn't [officially support Python3](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/python_3_support.html).
* The language is *really* loosly typed
* The language is struggling to progress and evolve.
* The syntax is described as being 'pretty', but all I see is a condensed, loosely typed mess of spaghetti code.
* Things produced with the language generally don't excite me, nor do I identify any real innovation in the community.
* Ugly function names are seriously going to make me stab my eyes out if I don't take precautions.
