As a part of a particular maintenance task I do occasionally, I audit my Ansible roles.

This is to ensure they're built using a consistent set of standards and quality.

As time progresses, I learn certain things which make my life easier, which help the roles become better quality products. Good quality Ansible roles are in my opinion, few and far between - I can only depend on one other person to eloquently compose an Ansible role.

So in this latest audit, I look at supporting more linux distributions, remove the use of `become`, as it should be the responsibility of the operations staff to execute the playbook as the desired user - and I do provide an easy override way. Simple things like this contribute a long way to making a better product.

I did publicly state how many headaches PyEnv has given me, but a lot of those bigger problems have been sorted out and the project is much more maintainable longer-term. This release will not remove support for PyEnv.

Progress overall is rather well, but I'll be happy once all of the roles are of the same quality.

In my upcoming Python role revamp, there are... many changes, most prominently feature the following:

* General clean-up
* Adds many more travis tests
* Officially supports many more linux distributions
* Officially tests for idempotence
* Fixes the broken Ansible badge
* Adjusts metadata for Galaxy
* Isolates cleanup tasks
* Fixes dependencies (to be as-recommended)
* No longer executes commands using `become`
* Task changes to support idempotent ideology
* Audit of the shell profiles
* Consolidates some variable declarations
* Cleans up Jinja2 syntax warnings
* Removes the need for OS-specific variable files
